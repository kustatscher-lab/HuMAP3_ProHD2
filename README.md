# ProHD2_huMAP3

# Covariation and All-IN score
Analysis and Datasets integrating ProHD2 and hu.MAP3.0 scores to derive a complex-level covariation analysis. Accompanied by covariation analysis of ProCAN (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2022.06.010) and the derivation of the ALL-IN mutually exclusive score

# Figures
Covariation and ProCAN figures in the hu.MAP3.0 manuscript can be reproduced from this repository.
